In React Native, a subtle bug can occur when using the FlatList component with a large dataset and complex item rendering.  If the items in your data array change frequently, and you're not properly managing the keys prop for FlatList, it might lead to unexpected behavior such as incorrect item positioning, rendering glitches, or performance issues.  The root cause is often that React Native's diffing algorithm struggles to identify changes efficiently without unique keys.
